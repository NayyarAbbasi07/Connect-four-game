To adapt the Connect Four game for an 8x8 grid, you'll need to make some adjustments to the game setup, such as changing the grid size and updating the winning condition logic. Here's how you can describe the Connect Four game for an 8x8 grid in C++:

1. **Game Setup**:
   - Create an 8x8 grid represented using a 2D array or a vector of vectors.
   - Define player colors, such as 'X' for player 1 and 'O' for player 2.

2. **Game Loop**:
   - Alternately prompt players for their moves.
   - Each move involves selecting a column where the player wants to drop their disc.
   - Ensure that the disc falls to the lowest available position in the selected column.
   - After each move, check if the current player has achieved a winning configuration or if the board is full.

3. **Winning Condition**:
   - Modify the winning condition logic to check for four consecutive discs of the same color in a row, column, or diagonal on the 8x8 grid.
   - Adapt the logic to handle the larger grid size while ensuring efficiency and accuracy in detecting winning configurations.

4. **Draw Condition**:
   - If the board is completely filled with discs and no winning configuration is found, declare the game as a draw.

5. **Displaying the Board**:
   - Print the current state of the 8x8 grid after each move to visualize the game progress.
   - Use ASCII characters or graphical representations to display the discs on the larger grid.

6. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate player inputs to ensure they are within the range of valid column numbers and that the selected column is not already full.

7. **Restart Option**:
   - After the game ends (either by a win or a draw), ask the players if they want to play again.
   - If yes, reset the board and start a new game; if no, exit the program.

8. **Additional Features**:
   - Consider implementing additional features such as undo/redo moves, AI opponent for single-player mode, or customizable board sizes for added complexity and flexibility.

By adjusting the game mechanics and logic to accommodate the larger 8x8 grid size, you can create an engaging and challenging Connect Four game experience in C++.
